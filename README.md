# OpenSauced Browser Extension

This project is my basic version for [OpenSauced Extension](https://github.com/open-sauced/browser-extensions/)! This is a simple and easy-to-use Extension that enhances your GitHub experience by providing useful information and features.

## Features

- Check if a GitHub user has an OpenSauced account
- Adds a button beneath the follow button to quickly navigate to that user's OpenSauced profile
- Add your own highlights to your OpenSauced account

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file
2. cd over to vite-extension and run the command `npm run dev`. It'll generate a dist folder on the current path 
2. Open your browser and go to the extensions page
3. Enable developer mode
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the dist folder

## Technical details

- This is a vite-react powered browser Extension made with the [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/getting-started/vanilla-js/create-project) guidance. CRXJS makes it easy to set up a Chrome Extension project with a modern development experience.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, you can use it on any user's GitHub profile page. Simply add the extension to the browser and it'll do its job, adding the 'View on OpenSauced' button.. you selece the desired feature from the popup window.
